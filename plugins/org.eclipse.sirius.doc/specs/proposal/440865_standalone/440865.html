SiriusStandaloneSetup) to initialize and configure Sirius for a standalone usage.</p><p>We should also be able to ship a folder with the complete list of jars which are required to use Sirius as a standalone app, or even better an uber jar using the maven shade plugin.</p><h3 id="UserInterfaceChanges">User Interface Changes</h3><p>This evolution will not change any user interface.</p><h3 id="DocumentationChanges">Documentation Changes</h3><p>The development guide targeted to the Sirius team should be updated so that guidelines regarding the standalone support and the cross-cutting concerns (logging, access to the workspace...) are documented.</p><h2 id="TestsandNonregressionstrategy">Tests and Non-regression strategy</h2><h3 id="howtoenforcethestandalonescenariosareworking">how to enforce the standalone scenarios are working ?</h3><p>By defining tests consuming the standalone jar.

EMFPlugin is one of those, enabling to use the classic log and resource locators calls in both standalone and OSGi environments.</p><p>TBD : This need to be investigated, how does its EMFPlugin patterns works, is that suitable for logging or access to the plugin singleton, is there any other tradeoff ? </p><h4 id="Abstractionvsconditionals">Abstraction vs conditionals</h4><p>There are basically two ways to achieve a pure standalone behavior. <br/>Either we add many IF ECLIPSE_RUNNING and hide the calls we <strong>should not make</strong> behind those, or we abstract them away.<br/>From a small experiment, what happens most of the time is :</p><ol><li>some code access the Plugin instance &#8211; which was not created as there is no OSGi runtime</li><li>logging fails because the ILog was not created by the runtime.</li><li>the workspace is accessed (getRoot().getWorkspace()) but is not opened and not accessible</li><li>Some extension point is parsed =&gt; Platform is not here, hence failure.</li><li>Probably some others..</li></ol><p>All of these are good candidates for a specific abstraction which would bring more consistency accross the Sirius code.</p></body></html>
